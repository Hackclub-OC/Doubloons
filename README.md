## Development

This site was made for a school project and was made in ~7 hours.
It uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React as the frameworks for building the site.

The entire site is based off of two main sections: 

- The Text (left side)
    - This will explain that part of the lesson
- The componnet (right side)
    - This will be an react component, often interactive that talks about the text and has cool visuals.

To run in development:

- Clone the repository.
- Install Bun
- Run `bun install`
- Spin up a development server on `bun run dev`!
- Feel free to contribute to the code!
